    <p>“In 2000, the New England Patriots and their then quarterback coach Dick Rehbein 
    chose me as the NFL’s 199th draft pick, which, if you do the math, means that I was 
    passed over by every team in the NFL somewhere between four and six times,” Brady said.
    Instead of letting this set him back, Brady remained motivated to target and improve his
    “deficiencies.”. “Much of the success I’ve been lucky enough to have in my career I owe to
    a lifelong ‘will-over-skill’ mindset,” he said.</p>
